        <h4 class="contentHeader">The Story</h4>
        <p class="contentText">The Flying Dutchman (Dutch: De Vliegende Hollander) is a legendary ghost ship that can never make port and is doomed to sail the oceans forever. The myth is likely to have originated from 17th-century nautical folklore. The oldest extant version has been dated to the late 18th century. Sightings in the 19th and 20th centuries reported the ship to be glowing with ghostly light. If hailed by another ship, the crew of the Flying Dutchman will try to send messages to land, or to people long dead. In ocean lore, the sight of this phantom ship is a portent of doom. </p>

        <h4 class="contentHeader">The Pub</h4>
        <p class="contentText">In 1985 two beer loving students called Laura and Tom moved to Uppsala to study, but even though there was a a lot of places to go to for beer - not one of them could meet the two friends desire in variety. So, four years after their first steps in Uppsala they started the pub The Flying Dutchman and ever since the pub have been a huge success. </p>
